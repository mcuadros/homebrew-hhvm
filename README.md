# Homebrew-HHVM

This tap has been **deprecated** in favor of the [official tap](https://github.com/hhvm/homebrew-hhvm). After almost  two years of work the [official support](http://hhvm.com/blog/10043/experimental-mac-os-x-support) for OSX has been released.

A big thanks to [@denji](https://github.com/denji), [@danslo](https://github.com/danslo) and the other 12 contributors.

> The original code is avialable at the [master](https://github.com/mcuadros/homebrew-hhvm/tree/master) branch.
